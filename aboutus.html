        <p>Marranito or puerquito is a traditional Mexican pan dulce (sweet bread) variety. These pan dulce cookie-like small cakes are shaped into pigs and flavored with ginger. They're made with a combination of flour, cinnamon, ginger, allspice, baking
          powder, baking soda, butter, salt, sugar, molasses, buttermilk, and eggs.
        </p>
        <p>Peanut butter cookie consists of hand-rolled dough that is then flattened with fork tins, giving the cookies their characteristical waffle pattern. It is believed that the dough is marked to help cookies bake more evenly, but some claim it can
          also be a warning sign to people with peanut allergies. </p>
        <p>This versatile American cookie usually consists of rolled oats, sugar, eggs, butter, and spices. Often, the recipes will also include raisins. It is believed that oatmeal cookies developed from Scottish oat-based cakes. However, it is mostly assumed
          that they originated in the United States. </p>
        <p>Despite its name, whoopie pie is actually an enlarged cookie sandwich consisting of two soft chocolate cake cookies with a sweet and fluffy white filling sandwiched in between. It is believed that whoopie pie has a Pennsylvania Amish origin, although
          today it is extremely popular throughout New England, especially in Maine. </p>
        <p>Bizcochito is the official state cookie of New Mexico. Deeply rooted in its history, it was originally invented by the first Spanish colonists of New Mexico as a way of expressing the local culture, customs, and flavors through gastronomy. These
          crispy cookies consist of butter or lard, sugar, milk, flour, baking powder, and spices such as cinnamon and anise. </p>
        <p>The intriguing fortune cookies are crispy folded wafers hiding an entertaining "fortune" inside. The "fortune" is a written note; a proverb or a universal prophecy believed to predict the person’s future. The cookies are made with flour, sesame
          oil, and sugar, and have a slight vanilla flavor. </p>
        <p>Graham cracker is a sweet American cracker made with graham flour and usually flavored with honey or cinnamon. The crackers date back to the early 1880s, when they were made with graham flour, lard or shortening, salt, molasses, and oil. They
          were invented by Sylvester Graham, a Presbyterian minister who introduced them in hopes to end masturbation – he believed that a radical vegetarian diet without white flour and spices would end lustful behaviour. </p>
        <p>Snickerdoodles are classic old-fashioned cookies that are rolled in a mixture of cinnamon and white sugar, consisting of butter, sugar, eggs, and flour. They are characterized by their texture (soft or crispy), a cracked surface of the exterior,
          and a buttery, sweet flavor. </p>
